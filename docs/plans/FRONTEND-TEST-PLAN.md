# Frontend Test Plan

Keep this file updated as frontend tests are created, changed, or intentionally deferred.

Do not execute this test plan unless explicitly requested.

The Lab Operations workspace is implemented, linted, typechecked, and included
in a successful client/SSR build. Barcode encoding, scan-first lookup/batch
entry, and reasoned print-outcome behavior have focused component coverage.
The remaining connected-workspace coverage below and physical bench acceptance
remain incomplete production-activation gates.

## Created Tests

- [x] `frontend/tests/invite-schema.test.ts` - `inviteSchema` accepts a valid invite payload.
- [x] `frontend/tests/invite-schema.test.ts` - `inviteSchema` rejects invalid email addresses.
- [x] `frontend/src/components/navigation.test.ts` - Phaeno context shows Data
  provisioning and hides the tenant Data Library.
- [x] `frontend/src/components/navigation.test.ts` - Prospect, Customer, and
  Partner contexts show the Data Library and hide Phaeno provisioning.
- [x] `frontend/src/components/navigation.test.ts` - order navigation is scoped
  to Customer lab, Partner reagent/assembly, and Phaeno operations/configuration
  capabilities without leaking the other organization-kind surfaces.
- [x] `frontend/src/components/navigation.test.ts` - Docs navigation is
  available as a primary workspace destination in Prospect, Customer, Partner,
  and Phaeno organization contexts.
- [x] `frontend/src/components/navigation.test.ts` - frequent workspace routes,
  including Docs, remain in the desktop toolbar while Data provisioning and
  Accounts and other administration or resource routes move to the user
  dropdown without changing permission filtering.
- [x] `frontend/src/components/application-branding.test.ts` - the selected
  Phaeno organization resolves to POMS, external organization kinds resolve to
  Portal, and the pre-selection fallback is Portal.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/documentation/documentation-registry.test.ts` - the
  maintained Prospect, Customer, Partner, and Phaeno registries expose unique,
  ordered, backend-indexable metadata, resolve slugs only within their audience,
  and keep Phaeno operational subtopics in one valid parent level.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/data-provisioning/DataProvisioningPage.test.tsx` -
  mock mode exposes the source surface without calling the secured API and the
  edge rail exposes all four Phaeno configuration sections with the active
  section identified.
- [x] `frontend/src/components/WorkspaceSidebar.test.tsx` - the shared
  viewport-edge sidebar remembers pin choices, switches sections, opens a
  non-modal rail from pointer hover or the accessible edge tab, restores the
  pinned rail on wide layouts, and omits pin controls on narrow layouts.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/data-provisioning/SourceSampleWorkspace.test.tsx` -
  draft discard requires a reason, sends the current optimistic version, and
  returns to the source registry after success.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/data-library/DataLibraryPage.test.tsx` - mock mode
  explains that connected tenant data is paused without presenting a false
  empty-grant state.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/data-library/GovernanceNoticePanel.test.tsx` - an
  organization administrator must provide remediation details and submits the
  current affected-organization concurrency version.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/organizations/LifecycleActionDialog.test.tsx` -
  organization deactivation names its access consequence, and entitlement end
  requires and submits a retained reason.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/organizations/EntitlementDialog.test.tsx` - the
  approved source-request selector includes only requests for the current
  organization and selected service while preserving a documented manual
  exception.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/lab-operations/Code39Barcode.test.tsx` - POMS
  barcodes encode with Code 39 start/stop characters and unsupported
  characters are rejected rather than rendered ambiguously.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/lab-operations/LabBarcodeScanner.test.tsx` - exact
  container lookup presents the linked work context and scan-first batch entry
  rejects a non-library container without changing membership.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/lab-operations/LabLabelDialog.test.tsx` - the
  browser print action waits for explicit physical success confirmation, a
  failed attempt requires details, and success/failure outcomes are recorded
  separately.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/lab-operations/protocol-definition.test.ts` -
  structured definitions round-trip for resume/clone workflows, older empty
  definitions open as one editable step, and invalid JSON is rejected.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/lab-operations/MaterialLotCreateDialog.test.ts` -
  supplier-lot validation accepts date-only expiration, prepared reagents
  require structured component lots, and modal related-reference creation
  requires names.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/orders/configuration/OrderConfigurationPage.test.tsx`
  - the five Order Configuration subjects use the shared viewport-edge
  sidebar, identify Defaults initially, and update the active subject when the
  user selects another panel.
- [x] `frontend/src/features/dashboard/WebOpsDashboardContent.test.tsx` -
  the two-button selector shows one mailing-list or demo-request panel at a
  time; panels render their counts, contact context, technical-brief state,
  explicit mock-data identity, page-size-10 footer paginators, independent
  pagination actions, single-page paginator suppression, and isolated retryable
  API failures. Connected panels require confirmation before unsubscribe or
  demo completion, explain that original intake is retained, invoke the
  selected record action, and show contextual success feedback; mock panels do
  not expose persistence actions.

## Requested Execution Log

- 2026-07-18: one-open-protocol-candidate workflow verification passed focused
  ESLint, `pnpm run typecheck`, and the client/SSR production build. A live
  authenticated browser review confirmed that Draft v1 replaces Add version
  with Continue editing, restores its saved definition, blocks the direct new-
  version route, presents a history-preserving discard confirmation, and
  reflows at 390 pixels without horizontal overflow or browser errors. The
  confirmation was cancelled and no protocol data changed. Frontend tests were
  not requested and were not run.
- 2026-07-18: structured protocol-version authoring passed `pnpm run
  typecheck`, focused ESLint for the changed TypeScript sources, and the client
  and SSR production build. A live authenticated browser review verified
  required-field errors, the three-step library-preparation example, generated
  JSON, unsaved-change protection, return to the Protocols section, and a
  390-pixel layout without horizontal overflow. No draft was persisted during
  verification. Frontend tests were not requested and were not run.
- 2026-07-18: system-owned Lab identifier verification ran `pnpm run
  typecheck`, `pnpm exec eslint src`, and `pnpm run build`; type checking and
  source lint passed, and both client and SSR production builds completed. The
  broad `pnpm run lint` command traversed existing generated `.output` and
  `.vercel` bundles and failed on generated code; no source-tree lint failure
  remained. Frontend tests were not requested and were not run.
- 2026-07-18: Web Operations unsubscribe and demo-completion changes passed
  focused ESLint, `pnpm run typecheck`, and the client/SSR production build.
  The repository-wide lint command also traversed generated `.output` and
  `.vercel` artifacts and failed on those generated files; changed source files
  passed the focused check. Frontend tests were not requested and were not run.
- 2026-07-17: POMS dashboard sidebar and Web Operations verification ran
  `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run typecheck`; both passed. A live mock-session
  browser review verified desktop and 390-pixel responsive layouts, sidebar
  counts and selection, Mailing List and Demo Requests content, and zero
  console errors. Frontend and Playwright test suites were not requested and
  were not run.
- 2026-07-17: the Order Operations navigation label changed from Reagents to
  PSeq kits. `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run typecheck`, and the four-test
  documentation-registry suite passed.
- 2026-07-17: Order Configuration sidebar verification ran `pnpm run lint`,
  `pnpm run typecheck`, the focused Order Configuration component test, the
  full `pnpm run test`, and `pnpm run build`. Lint and typecheck passed, the
  focused test passed, all 42 tests in 17 files passed, and the client and SSR
  production builds completed. The existing advisory client chunk-size warning
  remains.
- 2026-07-16: barcode completion verification ran `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run
  typecheck`, `pnpm run test`, and `pnpm run build`. Lint and typecheck passed,
  all 41 tests in 16 files passed, and the client and SSR production builds
  completed. The existing advisory bundle-size and plugin-timing warnings
  remain. Focused coverage verifies Code 39 encoding, scan lookup, batch
  context rejection, and explicit successful/failed physical-print outcomes.
- 2026-07-16: footer cleanup verification ran `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run
  typecheck`; both passed. A live browser check confirmed the legal ownership
  line and temporary support/policy placeholder, and confirmed the former
  framework/vendor list is absent. Test execution was not requested and was not
  run.
- 2026-07-16: the Accounts list and detail surfaces were aligned with the
  documented HubSpot-originated intake intent. `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run
  typecheck` passed, and a live Phaeno mock-session browser check confirmed the
  intent panel, disconnected state, Accounts terminology, and absence of
  standard direct-account/manual-request actions. Component and Playwright test
  execution were not requested and were not run.
- 2026-07-16: Accounts navigation and directory verification ran `pnpm run
  lint` and `pnpm run typecheck`; both passed. Navigation and browser scenarios
  were updated for the Accounts label and for excluding the internal Phaeno
  organization from the external-account directory. Test execution was not
  requested and was not run.
- 2026-07-16: user-menu organization-context removal verification ran
  `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run typecheck`; both passed. A live Phaeno
  mock-session browser check confirmed the organization search and act-as
  controls are absent while the remaining menu groups, Escape dismissal, and
  scroll restoration still work. Frontend test execution was not requested and
  was not run.
- 2026-07-16: context-sensitive POMS/Portal branding and dashboard copy
  verification ran `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run typecheck`; both passed. The
  new focused branding test was not executed because test execution was not
  requested.
- 2026-07-16: Shared workspace-sidebar verification ran `pnpm run lint`,
  `pnpm run typecheck`, and `pnpm run build`; all passed. The existing advisory
  chunk-size warning remains. Component and E2E tests were updated but were not
  executed because test execution was not requested.
- 2026-07-16: Lab Operations completion verification ran `pnpm run lint`,
  `pnpm run typecheck`, and `pnpm run build`; lint and typecheck passed, and
  both client and SSR production builds completed. The existing advisory
  chunk-size warning remains. Frontend tests were not requested and were not
  executed.
- 2026-07-16: clean-baseline verification ran `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run
  typecheck`, `pnpm run test`, and `pnpm run build`; lint and typecheck passed,

  typecheck`, `pnpm run test`, and `pnpm run build`; lint and typecheck passed,
  all 28 tests in 11 files passed, and both client and SSR production builds
  completed.
- 2026-07-14: system-documentation catch-up verification ran `pnpm run
  typecheck`, focused ESLint for the documentation registry, and the registry
  Vitest file; typecheck and lint passed and all 4 registry tests passed. Static
  checks also confirmed six portable MDX guides per audience and valid relative
  Markdown links.
- 2026-07-14: documentation implementation verification ran `pnpm run lint`,
  `pnpm run typecheck`, and `pnpm run test`; lint and typecheck passed and all
  24 tests in 9 files passed. The Vite client and SSR production build also
  completed with the MDX corpus compiled successfully.
- 2026-07-14: order-management implementation verification ran `pnpm run test`;
  all 16 tests in 8 files passed. `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run typecheck` also
  passed, and the Vite client/SSR production build completed through the
  installed Node entry point.
